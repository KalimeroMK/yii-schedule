# Upgrading Instructions for Yii Schedule

This file contains the upgrade notes. These notes highlight changes that could break your
application when you upgrade the package from one version to another.

## 1.0.0

- `Scheduler::run()` now forks a child process per due task by default. Anyone calling it
  directly gets the forked behaviour described in the README: `PostRunEvent` and the `after`
  listeners receive `null` instead of the handler's result, a task failure surfaces as a
  `RuntimeException` about the child's exit status rather than the original exception, and a
  handler must not reuse a connection opened before the fork. Pass `false` as the second
  argument to keep running due tasks one after another in the scheduler process, which is what
  `schedule:work --sequential` does.
